This programm allows to calculate simple expressions using shunting yard algorithm. It uses postfix notation also known as Reverse Polish notation.
This calculator implemets not only summation and substraction, but also division, multiplication and exponentiation.

Note: to calculate expression don't use any gaps between numbers
for example, "2*(4-4)" instead of "2 * (4 + 4)"
